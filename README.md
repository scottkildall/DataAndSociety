Data and Society
==================================

## Hello and Who I am
My name is [Scott Kildall](www.kildall.com) and I'm a new media artist and educator. 

These are some sample Processing sketches I use for teaching Information Visualization using Processing.


## Getting Started
These are some quick getting-to-know Processing samples, which I've adapted from from "Getting Started in Processing" book by Casey Raes and Ben Fry. I've also included quick a bit of my own sketch samples here.

The goal here is to show how to draw shapes and ultimately how to export as a PDF, which is what we will want to use for Illustator ouput (export to PDF)
